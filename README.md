# Fraction Data Class
This repo corresponds with the post on my blog, which can be found [here](https://midnightsnack.ca/posts/creating-a-fraction)

In it, we define a simple class that adds fractions as a data type to Python.
We avoid much complexity in favour of a short introduction before moving into more interesting topics in the future.
